## Background

Earthquakes across the globe w/ magnitudes of 2.5+ in the last 7 days have been plotted on a map using leaflet.js. Color and size of the bubble represents the magnitude. Background layers can be toggled between a dark map and a satellite map and earthquakes and tectonic plates can be turned on or off. Hover over an earthquake to show a tooltip that provides magnitude and location.
